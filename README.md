# ClockTube

### A tiny Android app to display a digital clock and a webview for watching YouTube videos side by side.

### Nice for using as a desk clock in the baby room when sleeping the baby with a music.

## Designed to run on Tablets (7" and above), may look weird on phones.

[MaterialCalendarView](https://github.com/prolificinteractive/material-calendarview) is used for displaying the monthly calendar.
